Snugglefish
========

Simple N-Gram Fast Indexer & Searcher (SNGFSH)

Description
===========

Got lots of malware and want to be able to quickly limit your search for an
arbitrary binary string to a much smaller quantity of files? Then snugglefish
is for you!

Check out this post which explains it:
http://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/overview/cybersecurity-blog/snugglefish-provides-quick-pattern-matching

This work is based upon a paper published by CMU CERT entitled "A Scalable
Search Index for Binary Files" which we highly recommend reading. It contains
some optimizations we have not yet implemented.
